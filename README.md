Step 3: Give each of the 4 categories people names based upon their grouping.
Step 4: Have these four people enter into a story building session based on a round robin discussion on the 5 Items making sure they address all the 5 Items adhering to the Conditions.  Label the rounds in accordance with the 5 Items being discussed.  Have each round include a summary of the discussion choosing the most engaging and suspenseful input for each of the five Items.  
Step 5: Use Dall-E to create a single image of the developed items emphasizing the Protagonist.
Step 6:  Have these four people use the 5 summaries to make a 5 bullet outline for each of the 7 Scenes adhering to the Conditions, and don't include the 4 people names, have them write collectively.
Step 7: Next, Have these four people use the 5 bullet outline for each of the 7 Scenes to write a single paragraph narrative addressing each of the 5 bullets from each of the 7 Scenes.
